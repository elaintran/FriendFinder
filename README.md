# FriendFinder
FriendFinder is a full-stack compatibility application that prompts users to complete a survey in
order to match them with others who have common interests. Initial user form submission utilizes the "GET" method to pass the result as a query string. The information is then retrieved, displayed on the survey page, and is also included in the "POST" route when a new friend is added upon survey submission.

## User Stories
One of UT Austin Coding Bootcampâ€™s full-stack assignments is to build a compatibility application with the following user stories:
* I can take a quick survey to see who my most compatible match is.
* I can find my match by having the least difference of answers between them.
